This is a laravel 12 project created using livewire-starter-kit. it has livewire and livewire flux components pre installed. It uses tailwindcss.

I want you to develop a livewire full stack application in this app. It's requirements and specifications are defined in #file:PRACTICAL.md file. The functionality mentioned in #file:PRACTICAL.md should be inside dashboard that opens after siging in. The contacts and custom fields in contacts have no relationship with user but only a signed in user can access these features.

Be sure to create a beatiful modern responsive and performant UI for this application which follows the styling and theming of existing starterkit dashboard's styling and theming.

In #file:PRACTICAL.md it's mentioned that you can use json fields or database table for storing custom fields but I'm telling you to use separate database tables, colums instead of json fields or anything like that. 

The application is already running at http://localhost:8000. 

After completing each step make sure that application running properly in both @Browser and @php . 

I've already signed up as a user and logged in to the application @Browser so you can access /dashboard and everything inside it. 

After completing each step make sure if there are any errors or bugs in application or it doesn't follow the instructions in #file:PRACTICAL.md then fix the code / UI and check it again for errors/ bugs and reiterate until it's bug free, errror free and follows the instruction in #file:PRACTICAL.md .
