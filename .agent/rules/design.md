# Design Guidelines

- Always make sure the designs generated are responsive, beatiful, modern and matches the style + experience of the existing user interfaces.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling to ensure consistency with the existing codebase.
- Maintain consistency in styles, colors, and typography throughout the application.

# Blade Icons

- This project uses [Blade Icons](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons) and [Wire UI](https://wireui.dev/components/icon) - [Hero Icons](https://heroicons.com/) for icons.
- When adding new icons, ensure appropriate icons from either Blade Icons package or wire ui or Hero icons are used in the project.
- Use svg icons if available for better scalability and performance.
